Automated Navigation:
The vehicle operates in a forward-only mode, navigating
predefined paths throughout the park.An RFID reader is installed on the vehicle to
detect RFID tags placed at various spots in the park.

Tour Start and Stops:The tour begins when the vehicle reads the
'start' RFID tag.At each designated spot (e.g., tiger zone, bird sanctuary), the vehicle stops automatically
upon reading the corresponding RFID tag.

Information Display and Audio Guide:
Upon stopping at a designated zone, the vehicle's LCD display shows information about the current spot.Simultaneously, an audio
output system provides detailed narration about the location, enhancing the visitor's knowledge and experience.

Scheduled Stops and Alerts:The vehicle halts at each informational spot for a set
duration, allowing visitors ample time to view and listen.Five minutes before the vehicle
resumes its journey, a siren sounds, signaling visitors to return to the vehicle.
Emergency System:An emergency push button is installed in the vehicle.When pressed
by any visitor, it triggers an emergency siren and sends an alert message to the
station.This ensures immediate attention and assistance from park staff.
